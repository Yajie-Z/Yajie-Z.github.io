journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {Telescope arrays are receiving increasing attention due to their promise of higher resource utilization, greater sky survey area, and higher frequency of full space-time monitoring than single telescopes. Compared with the ordinary coordinated operation of several telescopes, the new astronomical observation mode has an order of magnitude difference in the number of telescopes. It requires efficient coordinated observation by large-domain telescopes distributed at different sites. Coherent modeling of various abstract environmental constraints is essential for responding to multiple complex science goals. Also, due to competing science priorities and field visibility, how the telescope arrays are scheduled for observations can significantly affect observation efficiency. This paper proposes a multilevel scheduling model oriented toward the problem of telescope-array scheduling for time-domain surveys. A flexible framework is developed with basic functionality encapsulated in software components implemented on hierarchical architectures. An optimization metric is proposed to self-consistently weight contributions from time-varying observation conditions to maintain uniform coverage and efficient time utilization from a global perspective. The performance of the scheduler is evaluated through simulated instances. The experimental results show that our scheduling framework performs correctly and provides acceptable solutions considering the percentage of time allocation efficiency and sky coverage uniformity in a feasible amount of time. Using a generic version of the telescope-array scheduling framework, we also demonstrate its scalability and its potential to be applied to other astronomical applications.}
