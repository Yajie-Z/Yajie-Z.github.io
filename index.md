## About Me

Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the College of Intelligence and Computing at
<a href="https://cic.tju.edu.cn/english/home.htm" target="_blank">Tianjin University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/yuce/index.html" target="_blank">Ce Yu</a>, and at
<a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/" target="_blank">Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)</a> advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/prof-dr-daniel-grun-0.html" target="_blank">Daniel Grün</a> (Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics).
I received my B.E. degree from Hebei University of Technology in 2020. From 2019 to 2020, I participated in a joint training program at
<a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Massey University</a> and earned my second Bachelor’s degree.

My research lies at the intersection of computer science and time-domain astronomy, with a focus on developing intelligent and efficient scheduling methods for distributed telescope arrays in optical time-domain surveys. My research interests broadly include resource allocation and optimization, AI for Science, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing.

🎉 I will join School of Computer Software, Tianjin University as an Assistant Professor in December 2025. I am actively seeking collaborations in AI for astronomy, intelligent scheduling, and astronomical information technology. Feel free to reach out, I’m always happy to discuss research ideas or potential collaborations.
